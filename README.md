#Learn How to Create A Web application with golang

- As title

- I started working on it after I read: 

    - [Best practices for a new Go developer](https://medium.com/@IndianGuru/best-practices-for-a-new-go-developer-8660384302fc)

    - [Effective go(except for concurrent part)](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

- And what golang inspiring me is the concept of interface. It change the way I thinking about programming a lot! I think everyone should try and enbrace it!
